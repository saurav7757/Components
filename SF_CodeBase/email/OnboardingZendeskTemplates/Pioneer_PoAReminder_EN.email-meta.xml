    <subject>[Reminder]: Important documents for your new tax advisor pioneer</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},

Unfortunately, we still have not received your signed Power of Attorney for pioneer.

As previously mentioned, in order for pioneer to be able to act as your tax advisor, we&apos;d like to ask you to put the original, signed documents into your first box pick-up.

You can find the documents attached. Please complete this step by the end of the week.
