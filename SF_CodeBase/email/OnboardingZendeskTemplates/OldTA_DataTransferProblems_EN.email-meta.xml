    <subject>[IMPORTANT]: Data Transfer from your Pre-Advisor</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi there {{ticket.requester.first_name}},


For the complete transfer of your business&apos;s important tax- and payroll-related data, we need to collect data from your previous tax advisor and/or payroll accountant.

[Written cancellation note required]
Unfortunately, your previous tax advisor still requires a written cooperation termination letter from you. Until they receive this from you, they will not release any data. Therefore, I kindly ask you to get in touch with them to resolve these matters.

[Outstanding debts]

Your previous tax advisor has informed me that they are unable to release any data to me until outstanding debts are paid to them. Therefore, I kindly ask you to get in touch with them to resolve these matters.

[Unresponsive tax advisor]

Unfortunately your previous tax advisor has been unresponsive to both e-mail and telephone calls. Can you please reach out to them to ask that they respond to us? It would be great appreciated.

Once you have everything resolved, please let us know via a quick confirmation. Should you have any questions, you are always welcome to contact us at service@zeitgold.com or 030/30808111.


Thank you,

Jill at Zeitgold</textOnly>
