1. Your First In-App Tasks
To make sure you are all ready for your start, please log into your Zeitgold App and complete your first app tasks.


2. Send us a recent Z-Report and BWA
Furthermore, please send me the following important items via E-Mail to ensure any technical adjustments can be made:

A picture of a Z-Report from your cash register system (including the various available revenue types)
A recent business assessment (BWA) from your current financial tax advisor


Please complete these tasks as soon as possible, so that nothing stands in the way of our start.
