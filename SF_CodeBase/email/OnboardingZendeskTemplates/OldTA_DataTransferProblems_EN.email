Hi there {{ticket.requester.first_name}},</p>
<p><br />For the complete transfer of your business's important tax- and payroll-related data, we need to collect data from your previous tax advisor and/or payroll accountant.</p>
<p><strong>[Written cancellation note required]</strong><br />Unfortunately, your previous tax advisor still requires a written cooperation termination letter from you. Until they receive this from you, they will not release any data. Therefore, I kindly ask you to get in touch with them to resolve these matters.</p>
<p><strong>[Outstanding debts]</strong></p>
<p>Your previous tax advisor has informed me that they are unable to release any data to me until outstanding debts are paid to them. Therefore, I kindly ask you to get in touch with them to resolve these matters.</p>
<p><strong>[Unresponsive tax advisor]</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately your previous tax advisor has been unresponsive to both e-mail and telephone calls. Can you please reach out to them to ask that they respond to us? It would be great appreciated.</p>
<p>Once you have everything resolved, please let us know via a quick confirmation. Should you have any questions, you are always welcome to contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:service@zeitgold.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-nofollow="true">service@zeitgold.com</a>&nbsp;or 030/30808111.</p>
<p><br />Thank you,</p>
<p>Jill at Zeitgold</p>
