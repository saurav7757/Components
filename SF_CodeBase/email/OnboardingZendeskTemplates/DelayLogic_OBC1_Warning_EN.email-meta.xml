    <subject>[URGENT]: Scheduling your first Onboarding Call</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},


A very warm welcome once again to Zeitgold!
I have noticed that you have not yet scheduled your first Onboarding Call with me.

In order to ensure your start date with Zeitgold will be the [START DATE], please schedule a call by the [OBC1 DELAY DATE].

If you still have not scheduled a call by this date, we will unfortunately have to postpone our cooperation until the [01.DELAY MONTH.YEAR].

You can book a call using the following link: [ONB OWNER OBC1 CALENDLY LINK]

If you have any questions, we are available at any time at service@zeitgold.com or 030/30808111.
I look forward to accompanying your through our Onboarding Process!

All my best,
