    <textOnly>Hello again {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},


I see that your first Onboarding Call with me has unfortunately still not been scheduled.

Due to this, we regret to inform you that we will be postponing our cooperation until the [01.DELAY MONTH.YEAR].

We will get in touch with you accordingly to resume Onboarding for the new start dates.

If you have any questions, we are available at any time at service@zeitgold.com or 030/30808111.
