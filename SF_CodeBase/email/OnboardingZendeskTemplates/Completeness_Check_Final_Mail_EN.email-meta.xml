    <textOnly>Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},


Thanks so much for the recent submission of your documents! In order to unlock all the Zeitgold services, especially your monthly business assessments and year-end statements, we still need a few important documents:


1. Business Assessment (in German, Betriebswirtschaftliche Auswertung (BWA))

Please supply us with the following:

[INDIVIDUALLY UPDATE LIST]

A BWA or similar with the totals and debit balances for the month prior to your start with Zeitgold

Rental agreements/contracts for your business premises

Current loan agreements

Current lease agreements



When does Zeitgold need these? To prepare your monthly business assessments as effectively as possible, please provide us with these in the next box-pick-up or via your digital &quot;other&quot; box-e-mail-address.


2. Year-End/Annual Statement (in German, Jahresabschluss)

Please supply us with the following:

[INDIVIDUALLY UPDATE LIST]

Your business&apos;s contractual agreement

Important business-related records (including documents which account for the changing or business owners, shareholders, management structure, etc.)

Year-End statement from the previous fiscal years (if available)

Sales agreements from the previous fiscal years (if available)

Working contracts for all of your employees



When does Zeitgold need these? We need these as soon as possible to guarantee a timely and accurate preparation of your year-end statement and avoid any late fees which the financial office may issue. Ideally, send us these documents in the next box-pick-up or send them via your digital &quot;other&quot; box-e-mail-address.


Once we receive these documents, we can then conclude Onboarding and forward all documentation to your new tax advisory partner, pioneer Steuerberatungsgesellschaft mbH.

If you have any questions, you can always reach us at service@zeitgold.com or 030/3031811.


Kind regards,
